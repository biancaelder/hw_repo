    "Answer: This project sought to determine possible correlation between graduate admission and a candidate's gre, gpa,and prestige of undergraduate institution. Preliminary findings (via  logiistic regression) suggest that while gre and gpa have a slight positive correlation with admission, the prestige of undergraduate admission is a more significant determinant in a candidate's admission. \n",

    "While this project has successfully determined a correlation between admission and prestige, many opportunities for extending this research remain. For instance, one limitation of this project was the small, UCLA-only sample. Further research is needed to determine if these findings are specific to UCLA or if they are applicable across a range of institutions. It might also be beneficial to extend the independent variables under consideration (e.g., undergraduate degree, years out of school, program, etc.)when applying to graduate programs.  "
