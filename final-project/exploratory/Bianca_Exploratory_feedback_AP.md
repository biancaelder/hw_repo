I love the idea of the data dictionary in the beginning, however, it is very messy and hard to follow. Try to use markdown syntax to help clean it up (ie. Use bold/italic, spacing better, etc). 
Here is a link to give you a sense of some markdown syntax: [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
You also have a number of diagrams without any real explanation. Try to bring a reader into your thought process by explaining what the graphics are showing you and how they affect your decisions for building your model. 
It also seems like you started to work on building/training your model but ran into some syntax errors, let's schedule some office hours to specifically go over issues while you work on this next phase of the project.
