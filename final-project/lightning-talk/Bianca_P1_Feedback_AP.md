We've discussed your topic over the past couple of office hours and I think you have a great data set coming together. A great thing to focus on might be the ability to score an individual before they even enter a speed dating room. I'm sure many people have their own preconceived notions of who they are and how they might do in these situations, but what if you could take the review data that each candidate received from their dates and try to create a predictive model that would take someones personal attributes (interests, physical appearance, professional accomplishments etc) and give them a score of what they can expect? (is it worth it for any individual to put in the time, money and effort for speed dating?)
If you have numerical scores then a linear regression model might come in handy, otherwise if it is simply a "yes" or "no" to a second date, then you might be able to use a logistic regression to produce a probability that an individual would get a second date prior to entering the room. We'll cover logisitic regression in class soon.
