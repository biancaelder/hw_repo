**Notes:** <br>
- Great exploratory analysis and visualizing your data to find the most telling details of the data. <br>
- Try to take the next step and build out that logistic regression model to use it for predicting whether a match occurred. <br>
- Another cool thing to explore is to compare where the people were actually rated on average vs what they rated themselves.  <br>
